{[Confirming their commitment to] / [Each Party confirms its commitment to] // [Recognizing the importance of] / [Each Party recognizes the importance of] promoting innovation, creativity and deeper economic integration through:

    effective and adequate creation, utilization, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, and

[Option: [Current Article QQ.A.2 and QQ.2bis]]


[NZ/CL/PE/VN/BN/MY/SG/CA4/MX5 propose; US/JP oppose: The objectives of this Chapter are:

    enhance the role of intellectual property in promoting economic and social development, particularly in relation to the new digital economy, technological innovation, the [PE: generation,] transfer and dissemination of technology and trade;

    reduce impediments to trade and investment by promoting deeper economic integration through effective and adequate creation, utilization, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, taking into account the different levels of economic development and capacity as well as differences in national legal systems;

    maintain a balance between the rights of intellectual property holders and the legitimate interests of users and the community in subject matter protected by intellectual property;

    protect the ability of Parties to identify, promote access to and preserve the public domain;

    ensure that measures and procedures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate trade;

    promote operational efficiency of intellectual property systems, in particular through quality examination procedures during the granting of intellectual property rights.]


[NZ/CA/SG/CL/MY/VN/BN/AU propose: (g) the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.

    (h) Support each Party's right to protect public health, including by facilitating timely access to affordable medicines.]


[AU: Each Party confirms its commitment to reducing impediments to trade and investment by promoting deeper economic integration through effective and adequate creation, utilization, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, and through greater quality, efficiency and transparency in its intellectual property administration and registration systems.]


Article QQ.A.2bis: {Principles}

[NZ/CA/SG/CL/MY/VN propose6: 1. Each Party may, in formulating or amending its laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition, and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to its socio-economic and technological development, provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.

2. Each Party may adopt or maintain appropriate measures, provided that they are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter, to prevent the abuse of intellectual property rights by right holders or the resort of practices which unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect the international transfer of technology.

3. Each Party may adopt or maintain, consistently with the other provisions of this Chapter, appropriate measures to prevent or control {licensing} practices or conditions that may in particular cases constitute an abuse of intellectual property rights having an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market.]



Article QQ.A.5: {General Provisions}

Each Party shall give effect to the provisions of this Chapter. A Party may, but shall not be obliged to, provide more extensive protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights under its law than is required by this Chapter, provided that such protection and enforcement does not contravene the provisions of this Chapter. Each Party shall be free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the provisions of this Chapter within its own legal system and practice.


Article QQ.A.6: {Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health}

The Parties affirm their commitment to the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/MIN(01)/DEC/2).


Note: Potential proposal to bracket the clause in first sentence.

Article QQ.A.7: {Understanding Regarding Certain Public Health Measures}

The Parties have reached the following understandings regarding this Chapter:

    The obligations of this Chapter do not and should not prevent a Party from taking measures to protect public health-{by promoting access to medicines for all, in particular concerning cases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other epidemics as well as circumstances of extreme urgency or national emergency.} Accordingly, while reiterating their commitment to this Chapter, the Parties affirm that this Chapter can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of each Party's right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.

    In recognition of the commitment to access to medicines that are supplied in accordance with the Decision of the General Council of 30 August 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph Six of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/L/540) and the WTO General Council Chairman's statement accompanying the Decision (JOB(03)/177, WT/GC/M/82), as well as the Decision on the Amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, adopted by the General Council, 6 December 2005 and the WTO General Council Chairperson's statement accompanying the Decision (WT/GC/M/100) (collectively, the “TRIPS/health solution”), this Chapter does not and should not prevent the effective utilization of the TRIPS/health solution.

    With respect to the aforementioned matters, if any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement, of any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, enters into force with respect to the Parties, and a Party's application of a measure in conformity with that waiver or amendment is contrary to the obligations of this Chapter, the Parties shall immediately consult in order to adapt this Chapter as appropriate in the light of the waiver or amendment.

Cooperation activities and initiatives undertaken under this Chapter shall be subject to the availability of resources, and on request and on terms and conditions mutually agreed upon between the Parties involved.



{Section C: Trademarks}


Article QQ.C.1: {Types of Signs Registrable as Trademarks}

No Party may require, as a condition of registration, that a sign be visually perceptible, [20] nor may a Party deny registration of a trademark solely on the ground that the sign of which it is composed is a sound [VN/BN/CA/JP oppose: or a scent] [21]. A Party may require a concise and accurate description, or graphical representation, or both, as applicable, of the trademark.


Article QQ.C.2: {Collective and Certification Marks}

1. Each Party shall provide that trademarks shall include collective marks and certification marks. A Party is not obligated to treat certification marks as a separate category in its domestic law, provided that such marks are protected.

[US/PE/MX23/SG propose; AU/NZ/VN/BN/MY/CA oppose: 2. Pursuant to Article 20 of the TRIPS Agreement, each Party shall ensure that its measures mandating the use of the term customary in common language as the common name for a good or service (“common name”) including, inter alia, requirements concerning the relative size, placement or style of use of the trademark in relation to the common name, do not impair the use or effectiveness of trademarks used in relation to such good or service.[24]]25[26]

Article QQ.C.3: {Use of Identical or Similar Signs}

Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, [PE/MY/VN/CA/MX oppose: including subsequent geographical indications,] for goods or services that are related to those goods or services in respect of which the owner's trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical sign, [PE/MY/SG/CL/CA/MX/VN oppose: including a geographical indication,] for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.


Article QQ.C.4:

Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third parties.


Article QQ.C.5: {Well Known Trademarks}

    No Party may require as a condition for determining that a trademark is well-known that the trademark has been registered in the Party or in another jurisdiction, included on a list of well-known trademarks, or given prior recognition as a well-known trademark.

    Article 6bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known trademark,27 whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use.

    Each Party recognizes the importance of the Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks (1999) as adopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of WIPO.

    Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse the application or cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark that is identical or similar to a well-known trademark,28 for identical or similar goods or services, if the use of that trademark is likely to cause confusion with the prior well known trademark. A Party may also provide such measures inter alia in cases in which the subsequent trademark29:

        is likely to deceive or risk associating the trademark with the owner of the well-known trademark, or

        constitutes unfair exploitation of the reputation of the well-known trademark.



Article QQ.C.6: {Examination, Opposition and Cancellation / Procedural Aspects}

Each Party shall provide a system for the examination and registration of trademarks which shall include, inter alia:


    providing to the applicant a communication in writing, which may be electronic, of the reasons for any refusal to register a trademark;

    providing the opportunity for the applicant to respond to communications from the competent authorities, to contest an initial refusal, and to appeal judicially any final refusal to register a trademark;

    providing an opportunity to oppose the registration of a trademark or to seek cancellation30 of a trademark; and

    requiring that administrative decisions in opposition and cancellation proceedings be reasoned and in writing. Written decisions may be provided electronically.



Article QQ.C.7: {Electronic Trademarks System}

Each Party shall provide:


    a system for the electronic application for, and maintenance of, trademarks; and

    a publicly available electronic information system, including an online database, of trademark applications and of registered trademarks.



Article QQ.C.8: {Classification of Goods and Services}

Each Party shall adopt or maintain a trademark classification system that is consistent with the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks (Nice Classification) of June 15, 1957, as revised and amended. Each Party shall provide that:


[CA oppose: (a) registrations and the publications of applications indicate the goods and services by their names grouped according to the classes established by the Nice Classification31; and]


(b) goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified in the same class of the Nice Classification. Conversely, each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being dissimilar from each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified in different classes of the Nice Classification.



Article QQ.C.9: {Term of the Protection for Trademarks}

Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than 10 years.



Article QQ.C.10:

No Party may require recordal of trademark licenses: to establish the validity of the license; [VN/MX oppose: [CL/BN/MY oppose: as a condition for any right that a licensee may have under that Party's law to join infringement proceedings initiated by the holder, or to obtain by way of civil infringement proceedings damages resulting from an infringement of the trademark which is subject to the license]; or as a condition for use of a trademark by a licensee, to be deemed to constitute use by the holder in proceedings relating to the acquisition, maintenance and enforcement of trademarks].


Article QQ.C.12: {Domain Name Cybersquatting}

    In connection with each Party's system for the management of its country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) domain names, the following shall be available:


        an appropriate procedure for the settlement of disputes, based on, or modeled along the same lines as, the principles established in the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, or that is: (i) designed to resolve disputes expeditiously and at low cost, (ii) fair and equitable, (iii) not overly burdensome, and (iv) does not preclude resort to court litigation; and

        online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact information concerning domain-name registrants;

    in accordance with each Party's laws and, or relevant administrator policies regarding protection of privacy and personal data.

    In connection with each Party's system for the management of ccTLD domain names, appropriate remedies,32 shall be available, at least in cases where a person registers or holds, with a bad faith intent to profit, a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark.

3. Where a Party has in place a sui generis system for protecting unregistered geographical indications by means of judicial procedures, a Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition of a geographical indication where any of the circumstances identified in paragraph 1(i), paragraph 1(ii) and paragraph 1(iii) have been established39. A Party shall also provide a process that allows {interested persons} to commence a proceeding on such grounds.

(iii) [NZ/CA/BN propose: Paragraph (d)(i) and (ii) shall not be used by a Party to undermine] [US propose: By providing exceptions and limitations under paragraph d(i) and (ii) a Party shall not {impair}/{undermine}] the adequacy of that Party's [MY propose: overall] legal {framework} / {system} / {regime} for the protection of effective technological measures, or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the circumvention of such measures, that authors, performers, or producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights, or that restrict unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances or phonograms, as provided for in this Chapter. [CL propose:139]


[MY oppose: (e) “Effective technological measure” means any effective technology, device or component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to a protected work, performance or phonogram, or protects [CA propose: copyright or related] rights related to a work, performance or phonogram [CL propose, CA oppose:, and cannot, in a usual case, be circumvented accidentally].]



Article QQ.G.13: {Copyright and Related Rights / Rights Management Information}


In order to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to protect rights management information:140

    each Party shall provide that any person who without authority, and knowing, or, with respect to civil remedies, having reasonable grounds to know, that it would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of the copyright or related right of authors, performers, or producers of phonograms,


    (i) knowingly141 removes or alters any rights management information;

Each Party [US/SG/MX/NZ/PE/JP/BN/AU/CL/MY propose: shall] [VN/CA propose: may] provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied where any person is found to have engaged willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain in any of the above activities.
Each Party may provide that such criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution, or public non- commercial broadcasting entity.144


    For greater certainty, nothing prevents a Party from excluding lawfully authorized activities carried out for the purpose of law enforcement, essential security interests, [MY propose: performing statutory functions,] or other governmental purposes, from measures implementing subparagraph (a).

    “Rights management information” means:

        information that identifies a work, performance, or phonogram, the author of the work, the performer of the performance, or the producer of the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, performance, or phonogram;

These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.

    [US/NZ/MY/BN/SG/AU/CA/PE/MX/JP propose; CL/VN148 oppose: Each Party confirms that the enforcement procedures set forth in Articles {QQ.H.4 and QQ.H.5 (civil and provisional measures) and QQ.H.7 (criminal measures)} shall be available [to the same extent] with respect to acts of [PE oppose: trademark,] copyright or related infringement in the digital environment.

    Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be fair and equitable. These procedures shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.

    This section does not create any obligation:

        to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce law in general, or

        with respect to the distribution as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.



    [US/JP propose; NZ/VN/MX/PE/AU/MY/BN oppose: The Parties understand that the distribution of enforcement resources does not excuse that Party from complying with this section.


Article QQ.H.2: {Presumptions}

        for a presumption149 that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner150 as the author, performer, producer of the work, performance, or phonogram, or as applicable, the publisher is the designated right holder in such work, performance, or phonogram; and

        for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter.

Article QQ.H.4: {Civil Procedures and Remedies / Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies}

    In civil judicial proceedings, with respect to infringement of copyright or related rights protecting works, phonograms, and performances, each Party shall establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following:

        pre-established damages, which shall be available upon the election of the right holder; or

        Each Party shall further provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been [VN propose; US oppose: predominantly] used in the manufacture or creation of such infringing goods, be, without undue delay and without compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements.163

        In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional circumstances, to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.

    Without prejudice to its law governing privilege, the protection of confidentiality of information sources, or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities have the authority, upon a justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer, to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls. Such information may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and regarding the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and distribution of such goods or services and of their channels of distribution.

    To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that such procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article (civil and administrative proceedings).

    In the event that a Party's judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties to the litigation bear the costs of such experts, that Party should seek to ensure that such costs are reasonable and related appropriately, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings.

    [US/AU/JP/NZ/BN propose; CL/SG/PE/MY/MX oppose: Each Party shall provide that such applications remain in force for a period of not less than one year from the date of application,170 or the period that the good is protected by copyright or the relevant trademark registration is valid, whichever is shorter.

The requirement to provide such information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.


    Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit {or confusingly similar} trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. A Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the Article is not an infringing good.

    Without prejudice to a Party's laws pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality of information, where its competent authorities have detained or suspended the release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit or pirated, a Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without undue delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee, or importer, a description of the goods, quantity of the goods, and, if known, the country of origin of the goods.172 Where a Party does not provide such authority to its competent authorities when suspect goods are detained or suspended from release, it shall provide at least in cases of imported goods, its competent authorities with the authority to provide the foregoing information to the right holder normally within 30 days173 of the seizure or determination that the goods are counterfeited or pirated.

    Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine, within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the procedures described under Article QQ.H.6(1) [AU/BN oppose: and (6)]178 whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right. Where a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the infringing goods, following a determination that the goods are infringing.

    Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to order the destruction of good following a determination that the goods are infringing. In cases where such goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, such goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.

    Where a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described in this Article, an application fee, storage fee, or destruction fee, such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures.

    Each Party shall include in the application of this Article goods of a commercial nature sent in small consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travelers' personal luggage.179



Article QQ.H.7: {Criminal Procedures and Remedies / Criminal Enforcement}180

    With respect to a pharmaceutical product that is subject to a patent, each Party shall make available an adjustment219 of the patent term to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process.

    For greater certainty, further to/consistent with Article QQ.A.5220, each Party may provide for conditions and limitations in implementing the obligations of this paragraph.


Article QQ.E.16: {Pharmaceutical Data Protection}



        If a Party requires, as a condition for granting marketing approval for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety or efficacy of the product, the Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person who previously submitted such information, to market the same [MY oppose: or a similar221] product on the basis of:

            that information; or

            the marketing approval granted to the person who submitted such information

        for at least five years from the date of marketing approval of the new pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party [MY propose:, or any other country where marketing approval is first granted].

        If a Party permits, as condition of granting marketing approval for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of evidence of prior marketing approval of the product in another territory, the Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of a person who previously submitted such information concerning the safety or efficacy of the product, to market a same [MY oppose: or a similar] product based on evidence relating to prior marketing approval in the other territory for at least five years from the date of marketing approval of the new pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party [MY propose:, or any other country where marketing approval is first granted].

        [CL propose: Alt (b) A Party may provide for the possibility of granting marketing approval or sanitary permit for a new pharmaceutical product based on a prior marketing approval in another territory. If a Party provides for such possibility, it may also require consent or acquiescence of a person previously submitting the undisclosed test or other data to obtain marketing approval in the other territory in order to authorize a third person to market a same or similar product (in the territory of the Party) for at least 5 years from the date of the first/prior marketing approval of the new pharmaceutical product.]

    With respect to previously approved pharmaceutical products, if a Party requires the submission of:

        new clinical information (other than information related to bioequivalency), or

        evidence of prior approval of the product in another territory that requires such new information,

    which is essential to the subsequent approval of a pharmaceutical product, the Party shall not permit a third person not having the consent of the person providing the information to market the same or a similar pharmaceutical product on the basis of the marketing approval granted to a person submitting the information for a period of at least three years from the date of marketing approval by the Party [MY oppose: or the other territory, as applicable, whichever is later] [MY propose: or any other country where marketing approval is first granted].222

    Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 above, a Party may take measures to protect public health in accordance with:

        the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/MIN(01)/DEC/2) (the “Declaration”);

        any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement granted by WTO Members in accordance with the WTO Agreement to implement the Declaration and in force between the Parties; and

        any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement to implement the Declaration that enters into force with respect to the Parties.

[MY propose: 4. A Party may for the purpose of granting protection under subparagraph (1)(a) and (1)(b), require an applicant to commence the process of obtaining marketing approval for that pharmaceutical product within 18 months from the date the product is first registered or granted marketing approval, and granted protection for such information in any country.]


[MY propose: 5. A Party may for the purpose of granting protection under paragraph 2 require an applicant to commence the process of obtaining marketing approval for that pharmaceutical product within 12 months from the date the product is first registered or granted marketing approval, and granted protection for such information in any country.]

[MY propose: 6. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 above, a Party may waive the protection under paragraphs 1 and 2 above, where it has taken measures


(a) in accordance with:


(i) Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement;


(ii) the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/MIN(01)/DEC/2) (the “Declaration”);

(b) necessary to protect public health, national security, non-commercial public use, national emergency or other urgent circumstances as determined by the Party.]



Article QQ.E.17: {TPP Patent Linkage}


    Where a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting the safety or efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the safety or efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of prior marketing approval by the Party or in another territory:

        that Party shall provide measures in its marketing approval process to prevent those other persons from:223

            marketing a product, where that product is claimed in a patent; or

            marketing a product for an approved use, where that approved use is claimed in a patent,

        during the term of that patent, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent owner224 [CA propose:225]; and

        if the Party permits a third person to request marketing approval to enter the market with:

            a product during the term of a patent identified as claiming the product; or

            a product for an approved use, during the term of a patent identified as claiming that approved use,

        the Party shall provide for the patent owner to be notified of such request and the identify of any such other person.

    Where a Party chooses not to implement paragraph 1, such Party shall provide that with respect to any pharmaceutical product that is subject to a patent226 [MX propose:227]:

        the Party shall not grant marketing approval to any third party prior to the expiration of the patent term, unless by consent or with the acquiescence of the patent owner [CL propose:228]; and

        the Party shall provide for the patent owner to be notified of, or make available to the patent owner, the identify of any third party requesting marketing approval effective during the term of the patent.229 230

Article QQ.E.20:	With respect to the first marketing approval of a pharmaceutical product that is biologic,231 each Party shall provide the protection afforded under Article QQ.E.16.1(a)-(b), mutatis mutandis for a period of [0] / [5] / [8] / [12] years from the date of marketing approval of such pharmaceutical product in that Party.232

Article QQ.E.21: For the purpose of Article QQ.E.16, a new pharmaceutical product means a product that does not contain [CL propose: or utilize] a chemical entity that has been previously approved by the Party. {In the alternative, a} A Party may {also} provide that a new pharmaceutical product means a pharmaceutical product that utilizes a chemical entity that has not been previously approved in the Party.233

Article QQ.E.22: Subject to Article QQ.E.16.3 (protection of public health), when a product is subject to a system of marketing approval in the territory of a Party pursuant to Articles QQ.E.16, QQ.E.20, or QQ.E.XXX (agricultural chemical products), and is also covered by a patent in the territory of that Party, the Party shall not alter the term of protection that it provides pursuant to Articles QQ.E.16, QQ.E.20, or QQ.E.XXX (agricultural chemical products) in the event that the patent protection terminates on a date earlier than the end of the term of protection specified in Articles QQ.E.16, QQ.E.20, or QQ.E.XXX (agricultural chemical products).


ANNEX A


    For {specified countries}, the following subparagraph shall apply in lieu of Article QQ.E.14 (2)-(3) (patent term restoration) as set out in Article QQ.A.X (general provisions):

    With respect to any pharmaceutical product that is covered by a patent, each Party may make available a restoration of the patent term or patent rights to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term resulting from the marketing approval process related to the first commercial marketing of the product in that Party. Any restoration under this subparagraph shall confer all of the exclusive rights of a patent subject to the same limitations and exceptions applicable to the original patent.

    For {specified countries}, the following subparagraphs shall apply in lieu of Article QQ.E.17 (TPP patent linkage) as set out in Article QQ.X.A (general provisions):

    Each Party shall provide:

        procedures, such as judicial or administrative proceedings, and remedies, such as preliminary injunctions or equivalent effective provisional measures, for the expeditious adjudication of disputes concerning the validity or infringement of a patent with respect to patent claims that cover an approved pharmaceutical product or its approved method of use;

        a transparent system to provide notice to a patent holder that another person is seeking to market an approved pharmaceutical product during the term of a patent covering the product or its approved method of use; and

        sufficient time and opportunity for a patent holder to seek, prior to the marketing of an allegedly infringing product, available remedies for an infringing product.

    For {specified countries}, the following paragraphs shall apply in lieu of Article QQ.E.16 and Article QQ.E.22 as set out in Article QQ.A.X:


    1.

        If a Party requires, as a condition for approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product that utilizes a new chemical entity,234 the submission of undisclosed test or other data necessary to determine whether the use of such products is safe and effective, the Party shall protect against disclosure of the data of persons making such submissions, where the origination of such data involves considerable effort, except where the disclosure is necessary to protect the public or unless steps are taken to ensure that the data are protected against unfair commercial use.

        Each Party shall provide that for data subject to paragraph 1(a) that are submitted to the Party after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, no person other than the person that submitted them may, without the latter's permission, rely on such data in support of an application for product approval during a reasonable period of time after their submission. For this purpose, a reasonable period shall normally mean five years from the date on which the Party granted approval to the person that produced the data for approval to market its product, taking account of the nature of the data and person's efforts and expenditures in producing them. Subject to this provision, there shall be no limitation on any Party to implement abbreviated approval procedures for such products on the basis of bioequivalence or bioavailability studies.

        Where a Party relies on a marketing approval granted by another Party, and grants approval within six months of the filing of a complete application for marketing approval filed in the Party, the reasonable period of exclusive use of the data submitted in connection with obtaining the approval relied on shall begin with the date of the first marketing approval relied on.

        A Party need not apply the provisions of subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) with respect to a pharmaceutical product that contains a chemical entity that has been previously approved in the territory of the Party for use in a pharmaceutical product.

        Notwithstanding subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c), a Party may take measures to protect public health in accordance with:

            the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/MIN(01)/DEC/2) (the “Declaration”);

            any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement granted by WTO Members in accordance with the WTO Agreement to implement the Declaration and in force between the Parties; and

            any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement to implement the Declaration that enters into force with respect to the Parties.

    2. Subject to paragraph 1(e), when a product is subject to a system of marketing approval in the territory of a Party pursuant to paragraph 1, Article QQ.E.20, or Article QQ.E.XXX (agricultural chemical products) and is also covered by a patent in the territory of that Party, the Party shall not alter the term of protection that it provides pursuant to paragraph 1, Article QQ.E.20, or Article QQ.E.XXX (agricultural chemical products) in the event that the patent protection terminates on a date earlier than the end of the term of protection specified in paragraph 1, Article QQ.E.20 , or Article QQ.E.XXX (agricultural chemical products).

1Section and Article titles and headings appear in this text on a without prejudice basis. Parties have agreed to defer consideration of the need for, and drafting of, Section and Article titles and headings. Such titles or headings that appear in braces (i.e., “{ }”) are included for general reference and information purposes only. Chair has also used braces in the text to indicate issues needing technical work.

2{U.S. Negotiator's Note: Delegations worked on this text during the Singapore Round to reflect a possible alternative to approaches appearing in Non-Paper from Salt Lake City Round. Delegations discussed whether this text should be preambular text or objectives text. Delegations also discussed the possibility of including concepts from TRIPS Art. 40 in this text or elsewhere.}

3Negotiator's Note: AU supports including objectives but is still considering the drafting and scope of this Article.

4Negotiator's Note: CA supports this provision in principle, but is reviewing the proposal.

5Negotiator's Note: MX will reflect further on the additional subparagraphs (g) and (h).

6Negotiator's Note: BN can support in principle but is considering discussion on QQ.A.9.

7Parties reserve right to revisit in light of outcome of AA.2 and QQ.C.2.2.

8A Party may satisfy the obligation in Article QQ.A.8.2(d) by ratifying or acceding to the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks (2006).

9For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement limits Parties from taking otherwise permissible derogations from national treatment with respect to {copyright and related rights} not covered under Section G (Copyright and Related Rights) of this Chapter.

10For purposes of Articles [QQ.A.7.1-2 (National Treatment and Judicial/Admin Procedures), QQ.D.2.a (GIs/Nationals), and QQ.G.14.1 (Performers/Phonograms/Related Rights),] a “national of a Party” shall mean, in respect of the relevant right, an entity of that Party that would meet the criteria for eligibility for protection provided for in the agreements listed in [Article QQ.A.6.A – must include WPPT (Article 3)] and the TRIPS Agreement.

11For purposes of this paragraph [Article QQ.A.7.1], “protection” shall include matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance, and enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as matters affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Chapter. Further, for purposes of paragraphs {1 and 2}, “protection” also includes the prohibition on circumvention of effective technological measures set out in Article QQ.G.10 and the rights and obligations concerning rights management information set out in Article QQ.G.13.]

12For greater certainty, “benefits derived from such rights” refers to benefits such as copyright levies.

13[JP propose: For greater certainty, it is understood that secondary uses of phonograms by means of television programs are outside of the scope of this Article.]

14[JP propose: For greater certainty, it is understood that public and non-commercial broadcasting with a mandatory receiving fee under a Party's national law is included in “free over-the-air broadcasting” in the context of Article QQ.A.7.1.]

15Negotiator's Note: Technical work is ongoing on the scope of the broadcasting exclusion.

16Chair's Note: As of May 16, 2014, discussions on Article QQ.A.10 Transparency are reflected in Addendum VI – Non Paper on Transparency.

17Negotiator's Note: CA supports in principle pending clarification of what is meant to “open to public inspection” in sub-paragraph (b).

18Negotiator's Note: AU/NZ/CL/SG/PE/MY/BN/VN/JP/MX/CA/US reserve positions {on paragraphs 1 and 2} pending final outcome of Chapter. All Parties agree to revisit this provision at the conclusion of this Chapter.

19Parties recognize the importance of multilateral efforts to promote the sharing and use of search and examination results, with a view to improving the quality of search and examination processes and to reducing the costs for both applicants and patent offices.

20VN can accept the protection of sound but only if it is given an adequate transitional period.

21[MX propose: For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be construed to obligate a Party to grant protection for non-visually perceptible trademarks other than sounds and scents.]

22For purposes of this Chapter, geographical indication means indications that identify a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. Consistent with this definition, any sign or combination of signs shall be eligible for protection under one or more of the legal means for protecting GIs, or a combination of such means.

23Negotiator's Note: PE/MX/SG will go with consensus on this paragraph.

24[PE/US propose: For greater certainty, the existence of such measures does not per se, amount to impairment.]

25Negotiator's Note: JP is considering this provision.

26[SG propose: This provision is not intended to affect the use of common names of pharmaceutical products in prescribing medicine.]

27Where a Party determines whether a mark is well-known in the Party, the Party need to not require that the reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the relevant goods or services.

28It is understood that such well-known trademark is one that was already well-known before the registration or use of the first-mentioned trademark.

29Negotiator's Note: AU opposes the last sentence of this chapeau, but is in discussion with NZ and US as to language that could resolve this.

30For greater certainty, cancellation for purposes of this Section may be implemented through nullity or revocation proceedings.

31Parties that rely on translations of the Nice Classification are required to follow updated versions of the Nice Classification to the extent that official translations have been issued and published.

32It is understood that such remedies may but need not include, for example, revocation, cancellation, transfer, damages, or injunctive relief.

33Subparagraph (a) shall also apply to judicial procedures that protect or recognize a geographical indication.

34For greater certainty, cancellation for purposes of this Section may be implemented through nullity or revocation proceedings, {small group to discuss making this also applicable to GI cancellation.}

35A Party is not required to apply Article QQ.D.3 and Article QQ.D.3bis to geographical indications for wines and spirits or applications for such geographical indications.

36{Option 1: For greater certainty, where the grounds listed in paragraph 1 did not exist as of the time of the filing of the request for protection or recognition of a geographical indication under Article QQ.D.2, a Party is not required to apply such grounds for the purposes of paragraph 2 or Article QQ.D.3bis in relation to such geographical indication.} {Option 2: No Party shall be required to apply paragraph 2 in respect of geographical indications that are protected or recognized in that Party before this Agreement comes into force.} Negotiator's Note: Parties are still considering the two Options for this footnote.

37[JP/PE propose: This paragraph does not prevent a Party from limiting the availability of the procedures for cancellation to a certain period after registration.]

38Negotiator's Note: JP support is contingent upon rendering the provision inapplicable to geographical indications protected pursuant to agreements.

39[MY/SG propose: As an alternative to paragraph 3, where a Party has in place a sui generis system of the type referred to in paragraph 3 as of [date x- already in place pre-TPP], that Party shall at least provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition of a geographical indication where the circumstances identified in paragraph 1(iii) have been established.]

40Negotiator's Note: JP support is contingent upon rendering the provision inapplicable to geographical indications protected pursuant to agreements.

41Negotiator's Note: AU/CA to confirm.

42[CL propose: For greater certainty, this provision applies to any modification made to an existing agreement.]

43[MX propose: For greater certainty, the protection of geographical indications in accordance with this provision may take place after the entry into force of this Agreement.]

44Negotiator's Note: MX/PE is still reflecting on the application of this provision with regards to its national geographical indications.

45Negotiator's Note: VN would like to use the word “termination” instead of “cancellation”.

46A Party need not apply Article QQ.D.X to geographical indications for wines and spirits.

47[JP/VN propose: For greater certainty, this Article does not apply to cases where a GI becomes {generic} after protection or recognition is given.]

48For greater certainty, the filing date referenced in this paragraph includes the priority filing date under the Paris Convention, where applicable.

49[MY propose: This paragraph shall not apply to protection or recognition of unregistered geographical indications by means of juridical procedures.]

50[CL/SG/MX/US/NZ/MY/CA/BN/JP/AU/VN propose: For purposes of subparagraph (b), a Party's authorities may take into account, where appropriate, whether the term is used in relevant international standards recognized by all the Parties to refer to a type or class of product in the Party's territory.]
Negotiator's Note: PE is considering.

51Negotiator's Note: VN supports subject to the list of GIs in the Annex.

52[CL/BN/SG propose: For greater certainty, the Parties acknowledge that geographical indications will be recognized and protected in the Parties only to the extent permitted by and according to the terms and conditions set out in their respective domestic laws.]

53Negotiator's Note: Legal scrub to determine placement in TM vs GI vs standalone.

54For purposes of this Section, a Party may deem the terms “inventive step” and “capable of industrial application” to be synonymous with the terms “non-obvious” and “useful”, respectively. In determinations regarding inventive step (or non-obviousness), each Party shall consider whether the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person skilled or having ordinary skill in the art having regard to the prior art.

55{For greater certainty, no Party shall be required to make patents available for plant varieties that are protectable in that Party under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants [1991](UPOV Convention).} {Negotiator's Note: AU would prefer this footnote to be in the main text}.
[Note: This formulation is premised upon the understanding that TPP Parties will make a commitment to accede to UPOV 1991].

56Negotiator's Note: US/JP reconsidering the inclusion of subparagraph (b) (provision relating to diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods), subject to consensus on patent landing zone.

57Negotiator's Note: AU is still considering inclusion of “alternatively”.

58A Party shall not be required to disregard information contained in applications for, or registrations of, intellectual property rights {made available to the public}/{published} by a patent office unless erroneously published or unless the application was filed without the consent of the inventor or their successor in title by a third party who obtained the information directly or indirectly from the inventor.
Negotiator's Note: Parties to consult on whether “published” is needed.

59For greater certainty, a Party may limit application of this provision to disclosures made by or obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor. For greater certainty, a Party may provide that, for purposes of this Article information obtained directly or indirectly from the patent applicant may be information contained in the public disclosure that was authorized by, or derived from, the patent applicant.

60{For greater certainty, a Party may provide for forfeiture of a patent pursuant to Article 5A(3) of the Paris Convention.} Negotiator's Note: Some Parties consider that this footnote may be necessary to ensure consistency with Article 5A(3) of the Paris Convention.

61Negotiator's Note: PE and SG are flexible with both options.

62Negotiator's Note: CA/MX/AU is still considering the options in this provision.

63[MX propose: For greater clarity, the duration of the regulatory review exception will be subject to each Party's national legislation.]

64Negotiator's Note: 1. Parties focused discussion on Option 1, as a possible landing zone, rather than Option 2; 2. Consider moving Option 1 (Bolar for pharmaceuticals) to the Other Regulated Products provisions. For some countries, that might potentially remove the need to include reference to “other products” in the section.; 3. Would it be possible to remove “generating information necessary” if the reference to QQ.E.4 remained?; 4. Given length and complexity of paragraph, could we break this out into two subparagraphs?; 5. Comment that the drafting/structure of the provision makes it a limiting provision rather than a more affirmative approach.

65Negotiator's Note: MX supports in principle, pending the discussion on QQ.E.13.

66Negotiator's Note: Parties did not discuss Option 2 in detail as some Parties indicated that it was not a possible landing zone.

67A Party shall not be required to apply this provision in cases involving derivation or in situations involving any application that has or had at any time at least one claim having an effective filing date before this Agreement comes into force or any application that has or had at any time a priority claim to an application that contains or contained such a claim.

68[VN propose: For greater certainty, a Party may grant the patent to the subsequent application that is patentable and that has a filling or priority date which is prior to the publication of the earlier application in cases where the earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or refused, either prior to or after its publication.]

69Each Party may provide that such amendments do not go beyond the scope of the disclosure of the invention as of the filing date.

70Negotiator's Note: MX/SG are willing to accept the Article provided that the sentence “without undue experimentation” is deleted. NZ can go along with consensus.

71Negotiator's Note: JP is considering this provision.

72[CA/SG/MY/JP/PE/MX/BN/VN/CL propose; US oppose: For the purposes of this Section [Patents], “publish” or “publication” includes making available for public inspection, which may include making available on the Internet.] Negotiator's Note: AU support for this FN is linked to resolution of Article QQ.A.10(2) and subject to clarification of the use of the word Internet.
Alt. [US propose; VN oppose: For the purposes of this Section [Patents], “publish” or “publication” means making available on the Internet.]
Negotiator's Note: Other relevant provisions in QQ.E (Patents) are QQ.E.6 (priority date re where publication of patent application has occurred) and QQ.E.12 (other information in respect of published patents to be made publicly available). CA/SG propose to move this FN to be attached to QQ.E.6.

73Negotiator's Note: US support for this provision is contingent upon accommodating exceptions provided under U.S. Law.

74[US propose; AU oppose: For greater certainty, this Article does not apply to industrial designs.]

75Negotiator's Note: AU is still considering (a).

76[CA/SG/MY/JP/PE/MX/BN/VN/CL propose; US oppose: For the purposes of this Section [Patents], “publish” or “publication” includes making available for public inspection, which may include making available on the Internet.] Negotiator's Note: AU support for this FN is linked to resolution of Article QQ.A.10(2) and subject to clarification of the use of the word Internet.
Alt. [US propose; VN oppose: For the purposes of this Section [Patents] , “publish” or “publications” means making available on the Internet.]
Negotiator's Note: Other relevant provisions in QQ.E (Patents) QQ.E.6 (priority date re where publication of patent application has occurred) and QQ.E.12 (other information in respect of published patents to be made publicly available), CA/SG propose to move this FN to be attached to QQ.E.6.

77Negotiator's Note: The word “published” is subject to larger discussions in this section concerning its scope.

78Negotiator's Note: JP can support this Article if JP proposals are accepted.

79[SG propose: Periods attributable to actions of the patent applicant shall include such periods of time taken to file prescribed documents relating to the examination as provided in the laws of the Party.]

80[JP propose: Notwithstanding Article QQ.A.11, this Article shall apply to all patent applications filed on or after [January 1, 2016].]

81Negotiator's Note: JP and US to lead work on an appropriate transition period for Parties who do not currently provide such a system.

82(a) “Quasi-judicial” is intended to cover primarily processes by patent appeal boards; (b) One Party suggested using the phrase, “or any opposing third person” within the scope of provision; (c) One Party suggested including provision on “judicial or quasi-judicial” proceedings in a footnote; (d) Some Parties suggested including “administrative” proceedings, in addition to, or in lieu of “quasi-judicial.”; (e) At least one Party expressed a concern that this provision goes beyond existing FTAs.

83VN can support only based on provision of transitional period based on factors including living standard of farmers. BN would also require a transition period. Parties are still considering certain technical issues on this provision.

84For purposes of this Article, a new agrochemical product is one that either (i) does not contain a chemical entity that has been previously approved for marketing in the Party, or for which a sanitary permit has been obtained (in the Party) or (ii) which utilizes a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved in the territory of the Party.

85For greater certainty, information available through subscription services that are open to the public to subscribe are considered to be publicly available.

86For greater certainty, to determine whether the applicant of a marketing approval made a “considerable effort” a Party may consider the time length to obtain the test data, the number of persons subjected to the relevant tests, the amount of financial and any other type of resource utilized to obtain the data and that a significant part of such data was generated by the applicant.

87Negotiator's Note: CA/US position is that QQ.E.23 provisions should be addressed in the Environment Chapter. The US/JP opposes the inclusion of this Article in this Chapter.

88Negotiator's Note: AU is considering this paragraph in light of the rest of the Article.

89Negotiator's Note: Appropriate placement within the Agreement of paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 is under consideration.

90Negotiator's Note: NZ/CA prefer the issues included in this paragraph to be discussed in the Environment Chapter.

91[MX/PE propose; CL/MY/SG/AU/NZ oppose: For greater certainty “derivative” means a naturally occurring biochemical compound resulting from the genetic expression or metabolism of biological or genetic resources, without human manipulation, even if does not contain functional units of heredity.]

92[PE/MY/BN/VN propose; NZ/CL/AU/SG/CA oppose: For greater certainty, the term “genetic resources” may also encompass its derivatives.]

93Negotiator's Note: Proponents of this provision could be flexible to move this provision to Chapter AA {Initial Provisions} in order to drive consensus.

94Negotiator's Note: Proponents of this paragraph could be flexible to move to Section B {Cooperation} in order to drive consensus.

95Negotiator's Note: NZ is still considering.

96Negotiator's Note: NZ is still considering.

97The Parties reaffirm that it is a matter for each Party's law to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works, performances and phonograms shall not be protected by copyright or related rights unless they have been fixed in some material form.

98References to “authors, performers, and producers of phonograms” refer also to any successors in interest.

99With respect to copyrights and related rights in this Chapter, the “right to authorize or prohibit” and the “right to authorize” refer to exclusive rights.

100With respect to this Chapter, a “performance” means a performance fixed in a phonogram unless otherwise specified.

101It is understood that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Chapter of the Berne Convention. It is further understood that nothing in this Article precludes a Party from applying Article 11bis(2) of the Berne Convention.

102The expressions “copies” and “original and copies” subject to the right of distribution in this paragraph refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects.

103Nothing in this Agreement shall affect a Party's right to determine the conditions, if any, under which the exhaustion of this right applies after the first sale or other transfer of ownership of the original or a copy of their works, performances, or phonograms with the authorization of the author, performer, or producer.

104Negotiator's Note: AU's support for this provision may be contingent on how the exhaustion issue is dealt with in General Provisions.

105For greater certainty, in this paragraph with respect to performances or phonograms first published or first fixed in the territory of a Party, a Party may apply the criterion of publication, or alternatively, the criterion of fixation, or both. [JP propose: A Party may also comply with its obligation under this Paragraph by legislating that performers are protected to the extent provided for in Article 3 of the WPPT.]

106For purposes of this Article, fixation means the finalization of the master tape or its equivalent.

107With respect to broadcasting and communication to the public, a Party may satisfy the obligation by applying Article 15(1) and 15(4) of the WPPT [and may also apply Article 15(2)] of the WPPT, as long as it is done in a manner consistent with that Party's obligations under Article QQ.A.7 (National Treatment).

108[CA/US/AU/SG/NZ/MX propose: For greater certainty, making the sounds or representation of sounds fixed in a phonogram audible to the public is not included in this right, except where done by wire or wireless means.] // [Possible Alt. Text: For greater certainty, the mere act of making the sounds or representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram audible to the public is not included in this right.] Negotiator's Note: CA proposes to do away with this footnote entirely if the 2nd sentence in QQ.G.15(b) is also dropped.

109[JP/US propose: For greater certainty, broadcasting or communicating to the public the sounds or representation of sounds incorporated in a cinematographic or other audiovisual work by wire or wireless means is not included in this right.]

110The term published in this paragraph includes phonograms that are made available in accordance with Article 15(4) of the WPPT.

111Where a Party has availed itself of an option contained in Article 15(3) of the WPPT, the obligation contained in [QQ.A.7 – national treatment] does not apply to the extent that a Party makes use of a reservation taken under that Article.

112Negotiator's Note: CA to propose footnote on conditions.

113[CA propose: Articles 7 and 7bis of the Berne Convention apply mutatis mutandis, with the exception of the provisions of Article 7(4), in respect to photographic works.]

114Negotiator's Note: MY agrees but reserves the right to revisit where there are changes to certain positions on substantive obligations in the Copyright Section, if required.

115Negotiator's Note: Delegations are considering the relationship between Article QQ.G.16(b) and new multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of WIPO and the agreements listed in Article QQ.G.16(b). Delegations will work to resolve this issue in Article QQ.A.6 (General Provisions – relationship to other agreements) or elsewhere.

116{In particular,} As recognized by the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (June 27, 2013).

117For purposes of greater clarity, a use that has commercial aspects may in appropriate circumstances be considered to have a legitimate purpose under Article QQ.G.16.3.

118For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, retransmission within a Party's territory over a closed, defined, subscriber network that is not accessible from outside the Party's territory does not constitute retransmission on the Internet.

119Negotiator's Note: PE is considering the use of the work “emissions” in addition to “signals” as an alternative.

120Negotiator's Note: If this alternative is used, it is understood that there may be changes required in this language.

121For greater certainty, this provision does not affect the exercise of moral rights.

122Nothing in this Article affects a Party's ability to establish: (i) which specific contracts underlying the creation of works or phonograms shall, in the absence of a written agreement, result in a transfer of economic rights by operation of law; and (ii) reasonable limits to protect the interests of the original right holders, taking into account the legitimate interests of the transferees.

123Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to restrict the importation or domestic sale of a device that does not render effective a technological measure the sole purpose of which is to control market segmentation for legitimate physical copies of cinematographic film, and is not otherwise a violation of law.

124Negotiator's Note: MY and VN oppose mandatory application of this Article to access control TPMs. NZ/CA's agreement to this Article is subject to securing sufficient flexibility to adopt exceptions and limitations to the prohibition on circumvention for non infringing uses. CL reserves its position on the approach set out in paragraph (d) pending national consultations and may support the approach in the consolidated text.

125{AU/NZ propose: For greater certainty, nothing shall prevent a Party from limiting “unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms” to infringing acts, where appropriate, subject to any other {remedies/liability} available under the Party's law.}

126For greater certainty, in this Chapter, cinematographic works and computer programs are included in the term “work”. Chair's Note: Ultimate placement of this FN to be determined based on when the word “works” first appears in this Chapter as this is a cross-section issue.

127For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose civil or criminal liability under subparagraph (a)(i) for a person who circumvents any effective technological measure that [MY oppose: protects any of the exclusive rights of copyright or related rights in a protected work, performance or phonogram, but that does not control access to such work, performance or phonogram.]

128[MY propose: A Party may provide that the obligations described in paragraph (ii) in respect to manufacturing, importation, and distribution apply only where such activities are undertaken for sale or rental, or to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright.]

129It is understood that this provision still applies where the person promotes, advertises, or markets through the services of a third party.

130A Party may comply with this paragraph if the conduct referred to in (ii) does not have a commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent any effective technological measure.

131Negotiator's Note: Parties' position on this reference is pending resolution of the discussion on QQ.H.4.17 (Civil Judicial Proceedings relating to TPMs and RMIs).

132For great certainty, for purposes of Articles QQ.G.10 and QQ.G.13, it is understood that willfulness contains a knowledge element.

133For greater certainty, for purposes of Articles QQ.G.10 and QQ.G.13, it is understood that a Party may treat “financial gain” as “commercial purposes” in its law.

134For purposes of greater certainty, no Party is required to impose liability under Articles [QQ.G.10 (TPMs)] and [QQ.G.13 (RMIs)] for actions taken by that Party or a third party acting with the authorization or consent of that Party.

135Negotiator's Note: Agreement ad referendum on bracketed text; further technical work required.

136For greater certainty, nothing in this provision requires Parties to make a new determination via the legislative, regulatory, or administrative process with respect to exceptions and limitations to the legal protection of effective technological measures previously [established in trade agreements in force between Parties or] implemented by the Parties, [provided that such exceptions and limitations are otherwise consistent with Article QQ.G.10(d).] (ref QQ.A.11(3)) (agreement ad referendum; further technical work required).

137[CA propose: For greater certainty, a Party may provide an exception to a(ii) without having to provide a corresponding exception to a(i), provided that the exception to a(ii) is limited to enabling an act that is within the scope for exceptions to a(i) under d(i).]

138For the purposes of interpreting subparagraph d(ii) only, subparagraph a(i) should be read to apply to all effective technological measures as defined in paragraph (e), mutatis mutandis. Negotiator's Note: agreement ad referendum on this footnote; further technical work required.

139[CL propose: It is understood that the circumvention of a technological protection measure may be permitted solely to enable the legitimate use of an exception or limitation under each Party's domestic law.]

140Each Party may comply with the obligations in this Article by providing legal protection only to electronic rights management information.

141Each Party may extend the protections afforded by this paragraph to circumstances in which a person engages without knowledge in the acts in subparagraph (i), (ii), and (iii), and to other related rights holders.

142A Party may comply with its obligations under this sub-paragraph by providing for civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of moral rights under the Party's copyright law.

143Negotiator's Note: Parties' position on this reference is pending resolution of the discussion on QQ.H.4(17).

144For greater certainty, a Party may treat a broadcasting entity established without a profit-making purpose under its law as a public non-commercial broadcasting entity.

145For greater certainty, royalties may include equitable remuneration.

146For greater certainty, “law” is not limited to legislation.

147[PE/CL propose: Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the discretion that the competent authorities may exercise when enforcing intellectual property rights.]

148Negotiator's Note: VN can accept this on the condition that VN's proposal on administrative measures as an alternative to criminal measures is accepted.

149For greater certainty, a Party may implement this Article on the basis of sworn statements or documents having evidentiary value, such as statutory declarations. A Party may also provide that such presumptions are rebuttable presumptions that may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.

150Each Party may establish the means by which it shall determine what constitutes the “usual manner” for a particular physical support.

151For greater certainty, nothing prevents a Party from making available third party procedures in connection with its fulfillment of Paragraphs 2 and 3.

152For greater certainty, where a Party provides its administrative authorities with the exclusive [VN propose: or non-exclusive] authority to determine the validity of a registered trademark or patent, nothing in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall prevent that Party's competent authority from suspending the enforcement procedures until the validity of the registered trademark or patent is determined by the administrative authority. In such validity procedures, the party challenging the validity of the registered trademark or patent shall be required to prove that the registered trademark or patent is not valid. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a Party may require the trademark holder to provide evidence of first use.

153A Party may provide that this provision applies only to those patents that have been applied for, examined and granted after the entry into force of this Agreement.

154A Party may satisfy the requirement for publication by making the decision or ruling available to the public on the Internet.

155For the purposes of this Article, the term “right holder” shall include those authorized licensees, federations and associations that have the legal standing and authority to assert such rights. The term “authorized licensee” shall include the exclusive licensee of any one or more of the exclusive intellectual property rights encompassed in a given intellectual property.

156A Party may also provide that the right holder may not be entitled to [AU oppose: either] [AU propose: any] of the remedies set out in [AU oppose: 2 and 3] [AU propose 2, 3 and 8] in the case of a finding of non-use of a trademark. It is understood that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of the [AU: any of the] remedies in 2, 3, 7 and 8 to be ordered in parallel.

157Negotiator's Note: US is withdrawing reasonable royalties for patent infringement ad ref pending outcome.

158A Party may comply with this paragraph through presuming those profits to be the damages referred to in paragraph 2.

159For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages.

160For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages.

161US withdraws ad ref Article QQ.H.4.Y on patents/treble damages pending outcome.

162[CA propose: For the purposes of this Article, “where appropriate” shall not be limited to cases where a Party acted in bad faith.]

163Negotiator's Note: This subparagraph was previously closed, but VN would like to insert “predominantly” before “used in the manufacture” in subparagraph b.

164Negotiator's Note: CL support depends on content of RMI and TPM provisions.

165For greater certainty, a Party may, but is not required to, put in place separate remedies in respect of Article QQ.G.10 (TPMs) and Article QQ.G.12 (RMI), if such remedies are available under its copyright law.

166Where a Party's copyright regime provides for both pre-established damages and additional damages, it may comply with the requirements of this subparagraph by providing for only one of these forms of damages.

167Negotiator's Note: PE/CL have introduced a footnote 139 to accommodate judicial discretion and are working with the US to finalize language and placement.

168[CA propose: It is understood that there shall be no obligation to apply the procedures set forth in this Article to goods put on the market in another country by or with the consent of the right holder.]

169[CA propose: For greater certainty, reference to “imported” need not include goods moving “in transit”.]

170[For purposes of this Article, a Party may also provide that the applicant may designate a shorter period.]

171For purposes of Article QQ.H.6:

    counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the Party providing the procedures under this section; and

    pirated copyright goods means that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the Party providing the procedures under this section.

172For greater certainty, a Party may establish reasonable procedures to receive or access such information.

173For purposes of this Article, “days” shall mean “business days”.

174[Negotiator's Note: AU is still considering this Article.]

175For greater certainty, the Parties understand that ex officio action does not require a formal complaint from a private party or right holder.

176[US propose: Subparagraph (c) applies to suspect goods which are in-transit from one customs office to another customs office in the Party's territory from which the goods will be exported. As an alternative to subparagraph (c), a Party shall endeavor upon request to examine such suspect goods not consigned to a local party and transshipped through its territory and destined for the territory of another Party, and shall cooperate {upon request} to provide all available information to the other Party to enable effective enforcement against such suspect goods.]
[CA propose: Alt second sentence to footnote 176: As a alternative to subparagraph (c), if upon conducting an examination of goods in transit, a Party suspects such goods are counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright, it shall provide its competent authorities the authority to provide information to other Party to identify those goods upon arrival in the other Party's territory.]

177Negotiator's Note: Further technical work is needed on terminology used in this Article.

178Negotiator's Note: There may not be a procedure to be invoked in respect of H.6(6), if the obligation is as defined in footnote for H.6(6) covering “in transit”.

179For greater certainty, a Party may also exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature sent in small consignments.

180In conjunction with Article QQ.H.7, nothing prevents a Party from exercising any discretion that it may have to also provide for administrative enforcement procedures and penalties. [VN propose: A Party that provides for administrative procedures and penalties as an alternative to criminal procedures and penalties under [this Chapter]/[paragraphs QQ.G.10(a), QQ.G.13(a), QQ.H.7.3, QQ.H.7.4, QQ.H.8.2, QQ.H.9.1] shall ensure that: (i) such administrative penalties shall be [of sufficient severity to provide a deterrent]/[substantially equivalent to criminal penalties as required by this Chapter and may not include imprisonment]; and (ii) its administrative authorities may initiate a legal action without a formal complaint.

181[CL propose: It is understood that a Party may comply with this paragraph where acts on a commercial scale include the willful infringing reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, of copies with a significant aggregate monetary value, calculated based on the legitimate retail value of the infringed good.]

182Negotiator's Note: VN will need to propose a footnote to address “commercial scale”.

183[CA propose: For greater certainty, for the purposes of this subparagraph, it is understood that a Party may treat “financial gain” as “commercial purposes”.]

184[AU propose: A Party may provide that the volume and value of any infringing articles may be taken into account in determining whether the act has a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or related rights owner in relation to the marketplace.]

185{For greater certainty, “financial gain” does not obligate a Party to provide criminal procedures and penalties in cases of de minimis infringements.}

186For greater certainty, it is understood that a Party may comply with its obligation relating to importation and exportation of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods by providing that distribution or sale of such goods on a commercial scale is an unlawful activity subject to criminal penalties.

187A Party may comply with its obligation relating to importation of labels or packaging through its measures concerning distribution.

188A Party may comply with its obligation under this paragraph by providing for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied to attempts to commit a trademark offense.

189Negotiator's Note: PE to confirm whether it can go along with this language.

190Negotiator's Note: US is prepared to drop illicit labels chausette ad ref pending outcome.

191For greater certainty, for purposes of Article QQ.H.7.4 it is understood that a Party may treat copying as recording in its law.

192[JP/MY/VN propose: For greater certainty, a Party may comply with this paragraph by providing criminal procedures and penalties for the act of transmittal that makes the cinematographic work available to the public.]

193A Party may limit application of this provision to first-run cinematographic works.

194[SG/NZ/AU/CL/MY/BN/VN propose: A Party may meet the requirements of this obligation by providing criminal procedures and penalties for the willful copying of a significant part of the cinematographic work for the purposes of commercial advantage {or alternatively on a commercial scale}.]

195{A Party that provides for administrative procedures and penalties under this paragraph [MX oppose: shall] also ensure that its administrative authorities may initiate a legal action without a formal complaint.}

196{A Party may comply with this paragraph by providing criminal procedures and penalties for the act of transmittal that makes the cinematographic work available to the public. A Party may also treat copying [CA: and transmittal] as recording to its law.}

197{A Party may limit application of this paragraph to first-run cinematographic works. [MX oppose: A Party may also exclude de minimis recordings from application of this paragraph.]}

198[CL/MX/PE propose: For grater certainty, a Party may comply with this provision where it provides for criminal procedures and penalties for the willful and unauthorized reproduction and/or communication to the public for purposes of financial gain of cinematographic works.]

199It is understood that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of the imprisonment and monetary fines to be imposed in parallel.

200A Party may also account for such circumstances through a separate criminal offense.

201Negotiator's Note: PE is considering language to address its concerns with “derived from”.

202Negotiator's Note: CA is interested in knowing whether “primarily” might be acceptable to the group in lieu of “predominantly”.

203A Party may also provide such authority in connection with administrative infringement proceedings.

204[JP propose: With regard to copyright and related rights piracy, a Party may limit application of this provision to the cases where there is an impact on the right holder's ability to exploit the work in the market.] Negotiator's Note: JP's support of this provision is conditioned upon acceptance of this footnote.

205For the purposes of this paragraph “a manner contrary to honest commercial practices” shall mean at least practices such as breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducement to breach, and includes the acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties who knew, or were grossly negligent in failing to know, that such practices were involved in the acquisition.

206A Party may deem the term “misappropriation” to be synonymous with “unlawful acquisition.”

207Negotiator's Note: PE needs to clarify whether it can meet the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3.

208For purposes of paragraph 1, it is understood that knowledge may be demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged illegal act.

209[JP propose: A Party may implement this paragraph, by applying it to the cases where such acts are committed willfully or in willful negligence.] Negotiator's Note: JP can support “or having reasons to know” with this footnote.

210The obligation regarding export may be met by making it a criminal offense to possess and distribute such a device or system. [CA/US/SG/NZ/MY/AU propose: For the purposes of this provision, a Party may provide that a “lawful distributor” means a person who has the lawful right in that Party's territory to distribute the signal and authorize its decoding.]

211For greater certainty, a Party may provide that “willfully receiving” may mean operating a radio apparatus so as to receive an encrypted signal.

212[CA propose: For greater certainty, a Party may provide that “receive and make use of” includes [MX oppose: viewing] [MX propose: displaying] of the signal, whether such activity is private or commercial.]

213[CA/MX/BM/AU propose: A Party need not apply the [criminal] offense in paragraph b in circumstances where [a person receives and makes use of such signal and where] the lawful distributor has not made the signal available to persons in the area where the decoding occurs.]

214Negotiator's Note: CL position will depend on the outcome of paragraph 1.

215[NZ propose: For greater certainty, a Party may limit “assisting another to receive” to mean publishing information.

216For purposes of Articles QQ.H.9.1 – QQ.H.9.3, each Party may provide that receipt of a program-carrying satellite or cable signal without authorization includes receipt of the signal with intent to avoid payment, or alternatively receipt of the signal without payment.

217Negotiator's Note: This is pending the outcome of horizontal discussions on the issue of levels of government covered by the Agreement.

218For greater certainty, the term “marketing approval” is synonymous with “sanitary approval” under a Party's law.

219[CA propose: For greater certainty a Party may alternatively provide for a period of additional sui generis protection to compensate for unreasonable curtailment.]

220Negotiator's Note: Parties to further discuss and consider need for reference to QQ.A.5.

221For greater certainty, for purposes of this Section, a pharmaceutical product is “similar” to a previously approved pharmaceutical product if the marketing approval of that similar pharmaceutical products is based upon the information concerning the safety or efficacy of the previously approved pharmaceutical product, or the prior approval of that previously approved product.

222As an alternative to this paragraph, where a Party, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, has in place a system for protecting information submitted in connection with the approval of a pharmaceutical product that utilizes a previously approved {AU/NZ/SG oppose: chemical} {AU/NZ/SG propose: active} component from unfair commercial use, the Party may retain that system, notwithstanding the obligations of this paragraph. Additionally, a Party is not required to apply Article QQ.E.16.2 with respect to pharmaceutical products covered by Article QQ.E.20 [CA oppose: or to pharmaceutical products that receive a period of at least 8 years of protection pursuant to subparagraph 1(a) and 1(b) of Article QQ.E.16.] [CA propose: A Party that provides a period of at least 8 years of protection pursuant to QQ.E.16.1 is not required to apply Article QQ.E.16.2.]

223For greater certainty, the measures referred to in this subparagraph may be in conjunction with a Party's marketing approval process.

224Negotiator's Note: Some Parties are considering possibility of a negotiator's note to address questions surrounding the application of this [paragraph/Article], that could be relied upon for the purposes of supplementary legal interpretation. This is without prejudice to CA's position regarding its prior FN 6.

225[CA propose: For greater certainty, the consent or acquiescence is with respect of those other persons bypassing the measures in the Party's marketing approval process that would prevent the marketing of a product and not with respect to preventing the marketing of the product.]

226For greater certainty, a Party may limit the obligation of paragraph 2 to the types of patents described in paragraphs 1(a)(i) and (ii).

227[MX propose: Where a Party has in place a system with the requirements set forth in paragraph 2(a) on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, it may retain that system as an alternative to paragraphs 1(a)(i) and (ii).]

228[CL propose: For greater certainty, Parties may comply with this obligation by providing for injunctions or other judicial proceedings within their patent infringement procedures.]

229{For greater certainty, a Party is not required to provide the notification or to make available the information set forth in paragraph 2(b), if that Party precludes the issuance of marketing approval or sanitary permit to a third party prior to the expiration of the patent term in the absence of legal enforcement action by a right holder.}

230For greater certainty, the Parties recognize that this Article does not imply that the marketing approval authority should make patent validity or infringement determinations.

231Negotiator's Note: Delegations discussed two approaches to a footnote on biologics, which are set forth below. Delegations had different views and preferences regarding these two approaches.
Approach 1: {For purposes of this Chapter, a pharmaceutical product that is biological means [at least] a vaccine, a protein, or a [AU propose: plasma-derived product, US propose: blood-derivative, JP propose: blood-derived product] for use in human beings for the prevention, treatment, or, cure of a disease or condition. A Party may limit the scope of such pharmaceutical products to products that are produced [US propose: at least in part, through biological processes involving living organisms, tissues, or cells, such as those involving] [US oppose: by biotechnology [such as]/[including]] recombinant DNA technology. [CA propose: Products that] a Party may exclude [CA oppose: the following] from the scope of such pharmaceutical products, [CA: include: ] blood and blood components, chemically synthesized polypeptides, and [US propose: naturally occurring] animal-derived polypeptides that are derived wholly by means of extraction and purification from animal organs and tissues [CA propose: or from plants]} Note: Delegations also to consider necessity and potential drafting of the following text: [CA oppose: For greater certainty, each Party confirms that pharmaceutical products that are not defined as biologics under this provisions [are subject to]/[shall be evaluated under] Article QQ.E.16.]

Approach 2: Self-defining / according to national law.

232Each Party may provide that an applicant may request approval of a pharmaceutical product that is a biologic under the procedures set forth in Article QQ.E.16(1)(a)-(b) within 5 years of entry into force of this Agreement, provided that other pharmaceutical products in the same class of products have been approved by the Party under the procedures set forth in Article QQ.E.16(1)(a)-(b) before entry into force of this Agreement.

233Negotiator's Note: CL does not consider the 2nd sentence necessary given the 1st sentence.

234For greater certainty, the Parties understand that the definition in QQ.E.21 for “new pharmaceutical product” is applicable to subparagraph C.

235Negotiator's Note: CL is still considering this proposal and reserves its position to the entire section.

236For the purposes of this Article, “copyright” includes related rights.

237For purposes of this Article, “online service provider” and “provider” mean a provider of online services or network access, or the operators of facilities therefore, and includes [CL oppose: an entity] [CL propose: any person] offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received [CA propose: other than modifications made as part of a technical process or for solely technical reasons]. A Party may provide that network access includes cases in which network access is provided by another provider. [NZ propose: A Party may limit the application of this Article to entities offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received, or offering the hosting of material on websites or other electronic retrieval systems that can be accessed by a user.]

238[CA propose: Legal incentives may be understood as exposure to potential liability under that Party's domestic copyright law.]

239{[CA oppose: Where a Party chooses to limit liability, appropriate court-ordered relief] [CA propose: Limitation in law on the liability of online service providers shall not affect any judicial authority, in accordance with a Party's legal system,] to compel or restrain certain actions [CA propose: where appropriate and] [CA oppose: shall be available,] subject to reasonable restrictions with due regard to the relative burdens to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the relief and whether less burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available.}

240[CL propose: For greater certainty, these limitations may preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable limitations on court order relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the functions referred to in paragraph 3 and shall be confined to those functions.]

241[CA oppose: {Placeholder for further elaboration on what factors may determine what is a neutral intermediary, with focus on separating out non legitimate ISPs that promote infringement}.]

242It is understood that, to the extent that a Party determines, consistent with its international legal obligations, that a particular act does not constitute copyright infringement, there is no obligation to provide for a limitation in relation to the act.

243[PE propose: For greater certainty, the failure of a service provider to quality for the limitations in paragraph 2 does not itself result in liability. Furthermore, paragraph 2 is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability.]

244[CA propose: It is understood that online service providers may control, initiate, or direct various acts of reproduction or communication that may involve infringing acts solely for technical reasons in carrying out the functions in paragraph 3 and as part of providing their services.]

245Such modification does not include modifications made as part of a technical process or for solely technical reasons [CL propose:, such as division in to packages.]

246For greater certainty, Parties may interpret “storage” as “hosting”.

247For greater certainty, such storage of material may include e-mails and their attachments stored in the provider's server and web pages residing on the provider's server.

248[CL propose: A Party may require judicial intervention for purpose of obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or awareness of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent.]

249Each Party understands that a legally sufficient notice or statement, as defined under a Party's law, must contain information that is reasonably sufficient to enable the online service provider to identify the work, performance, or phonogram claimed to be infringed, the alleged infringing material, and the online location of the alleged infringement and that has a sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the authority of the party sending the notice.

250A Party may comply with [JP oppose: its] [JP propose: the] obligations under [JP propose: the second sentence of] [JP oppose: sub] paragraph 4 by [JP propose: (1)] having a [JP oppose: multi-]stakeholder organization [JP propose:, which includes representatives of both online service providers and rights holders, with the government involved,] to develop and maintain [JP oppose: adequacy of institutional] [JP propose: adequate] procedures to verify [JP oppose: or underwrite] the validity of [JP oppose: a notice on] [JP propose: notices of] copyright infringement [JP oppose:, and by providing that a provider shall be exempted from any liability for removing or disabling access to material, (a) upon receiving the notice underwritten or verified through such procedures; or (b) upon receiving other notice after informing of such notice and not receiving objections within a reasonable period from the person.] [JP propose:, and (2) taking appropriate measures to limit the liability of online service providers for copyright infringement where the online service providers expeditiously remove or disable access to the material, upon obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or awareness of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, including through receiving a verified notice.]

251[NZ propose: for greater certainty, where no such liability exists under a Party's law, a Party need not provide any further exemption.]

252With respect to the function in subparagraph 3(ii), a Party may limit the requirements of paragraph 4 related to removing or disabling access to infringing material to circumstances in which the service provider becomes aware or receives notification that the cached material has been removed or access to it has been disabled at the originating site.

253[JP propose: A Party need not require such notification in circumstances in which the online service provider has reasonable grounds to believe that infringement is occurring.]

254[Negotiator's Note: JP would like to invite Parties' views on including other principles.]

255For greater certainty, “law” is not limited by legislation.

256Negotiator's Note: The definition of SOEs will be subject to resolution by the SOE Chapter working group.

257For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement limits Parties from taking an otherwise permissible derogation from national treatment with respect to {copyrights and related rights} that are not covered under Section G (Copyright and Related Rights) of this Chapter. Negotiator's Note: Chile will confirm.

258For purposes of Articles [QQ.A.9.1-2 (National Treatment and Judicial/Admin Procedures), QQ.D.2.a (GIs/Nationals), and QQ.G.14.1 (Performers/Phonograms/Related Rights),] [CA propose: subject to the flexibilities in QQ.G.14.1] a “national of a Party” shall mean, in respect of the relevant right, a person of that Party that would meet the criteria for eligibility for protection provided for in the agreements listed in [Article QQ.A.6.4] and the TRIPS Agreement. Negotiator's Note: Parties to remember to insert correct cross references to other treaties including WPPT (Article 3) depending on whether Chapter includes an obligation to accede to a list of treaties.

259For purposes of this paragraph (Article QQ.A.9.1), “protection” shall include matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance, and enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as matters affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Chapter. Further, for purposes of paragraph 1, “protection” also includes the prohibition on circumvention of effective technological measures set out in Article QQ.G.10 and the provisions concerning rights management information set in Article QQ.G.13.

260For greater certainty, “benefits derived from such rights” refers to benefits such as copyright levies.

261[JP propose: For greater certainty, it is understood that secondary uses of phonograms by means of television programs are outside of the scope of this Article.]

262[JP propose: For greater certainty, a Party may define “free” to include the imposition through legislation of a mandatory fee on the general public for reception of broadcast from a public and non-commercial entity specifically chartered by a Party's law, where that Party is responsible for the appointment or approval of the members of the entity's governing board.]

263Negotiator's Note: CA supports in principle pending clarification of what is meant by “open to public inspection” in sub-paragraph (b).

264Placeholder for footnote, indicating that this provision is without prejudice to the manner in which each Party provides for these rights under its law.

265Placeholder for language clarifying that the obligation does not extend to making the whole dossier open to public inspection.
